IO-Stream version 1.0.9

Non-blocking event-based low-level I/O is hard to get right. Code usually
error-prone and complex... and it very similar in all applications. Things
become much worse when you need to alter I/O stream in some way - use
proxies, encryption, SSL, etc.

This module designed to give user ability to work with I/O streams on
higher level, using input/output buffers (just scalars) and high-level
events like CONNECTED, SENT or EOF. As same time it doesn't hide low-level
things, and user still able to work on low-level without any limitations.

Architecture of this module make it ease to write plugins, which will alter
I/O stream in any way - route it through proxies, encrypt, log, etc.
